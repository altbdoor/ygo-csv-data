# ygo-csv-data

A small NodeJS script to convert data from [YGOPRODeck API](https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/), to a CSV file.

To a friend! ü§ù

## Setup

1. Have NodeJS installed
   - I used Node 16, but fairly sure it works with slightly older versions
1. Install the dependencies with `npm install`
1. Build the script with `npm run build`, which will create `./dist/main.js`
1. Download the JSON response from YGOPRODeck API for all cards
   - Please visit <https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/> for more info
   - <https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api/v7/cardinfo.php?misc=yes>
1. Run the script, against the JSON file
   - `node ./dist/main.js ./cardinfo.php.json`
1. Get `output.csv`, and have fun

## Notes

- The TypeScript interfaces were generated from the JSON file, with <https://github.com/jvilk/MakeTypes>
   - `npm run make-types` can be used to regenerate the `./src/model.d.ts`
- The data extracted here is specific to the needs of a friend. Feel free to hack the `./src/main.ts`!
